# shell

My work-in-progress shell configuration made with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me) to be used in Wayland Compositors and/or tiling window managers such as Hyprland, Swayfx/Sway, etc.

## Overview

A minimalist, misty shell concept designed and built for power users seeking a distraction-free, full-focus workflow while still remaining usable and accessible for most users.

It features a lot of widgets such as application launcher, workspace overview, power session, etc., that help mitigate the core barless concept.

Design reference is public and can be viewed and accessed in Figma Community:

(Only these are implemented for now :sob: but there are more to follow; meanwhile, check out the design file if you're interested)

> This repository is a submodule of a bigger repository. That said bigger repository is currently private, as it contains my whole flakes configuration, where some of the files present are potentially dangerous(?) to publicize. I still need to clean them up, but cannot find the right time for now. Maybe soonâ„¢.
