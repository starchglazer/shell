# shell

My shell configuration made with Quickshell to be used in Wayland Compositors and/or tiling window managers such as Hyprland, Sway, etc.

## Overview

A minimalist, misty shell concept designed for power users to be distraction-free and encourage full-focus mode, but should still be (hopefully) usable for most users.

It features a lot of widgets such as application launcher, workspace overview, power session, etc., that help mitigate the core barless concept.

Design reference is public and can be viewed and accessed in Figma Community:

## Screenshots

None for now :(

Just check out the design reference, I guess ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
